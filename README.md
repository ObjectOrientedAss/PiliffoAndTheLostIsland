# Piliffo And The Lost Island
This is a small Unity game realized in 72 hours at the Global Game Jam 2021 held in Rome.
I've developed the interaction system, the crafting/refine/building system, the inventory backend, the camera and the controls.

## The Theme
Lost and found. During our brainstorming we came up with the simple idea of a castaway, lost on a caraibic island, with the task of completing a complex SOS signal, and use it to be found by aids to go back home. The answer to your question is: yeah, we had no designers. Don't bother me.

## The Game
You are Piliffo (which is anagram of Filippo, one of the members of our team), a castaway with just an axe, and a big willing to survive. The island has some resources like stones, sticks, and... well, basically just these. Anyway, you can pick up stuff around, use your crafting system to refine in more complex materials, and then use them to build an SOS step by step. Each step requires "more" and "more complex" materials. You will also need a "very special" material in order to complete the last step.
But be warned: you may not be alone on the island...

## The Experience
It was pretty funny, the team was composed by friends and colleagues, and we enjoyed putting all these silly things together. Expecially the hats feature, ahem...

## What would i do better NOW?
Basically everything? Just kidding, with a little more time i would like to see a better AI, more materials, more things to build and craft, and probably a better UI integration (yes, we are perfectly aware of the fact that you can drop materials to negative and CHEAT). I would also like to see a better water shader, possibly avoiding the quad's spotting from miles of distance...

## The result
Of course we didn't win, but it was my second global game jam, so i didn't expect anything different. Main thing was having fun, and we had it.

## What now?
This is probably one of the projects that could be re-opened and upgraded into something more real and concrete. We'll see!
